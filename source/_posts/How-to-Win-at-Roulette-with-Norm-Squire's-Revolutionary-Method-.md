#  How to Win at Roulette with Norm Squire's Revolutionary Method 

In the 1980s, Norm Squire came up with a revolutionary method to win at roulette. Roulette is a game of chance that involves betting on the outcome of a spinning wheel. Players can bet on a variety of outcomes, including numbers, colors, and groups of numbers.

Norm Squire's method is based on probability theory. He developed a system that calculates the likelihood of each possible outcome on any given spin of the wheel. By using this system, players can make informed decisions about where to place their bets in order to maximize their chances of winning.

There are two basic principles behind Squire's method: 
- The first principle is that you should always bet on more than one number at a time. This increases your chances of winning because the odds are not in favor of any particular number. 
- The second principle is that you should always double your bets after each loss. This increases your chances of winning back your lost money and making a profit.

Squire's method is not infallible, but it does give players a significant advantage over the house edge. With a little practice, you can use this method to win at roulette consistently and make some money in the process!

#  How to Win at Roulette – Guaranteed! 

There is no one definitive answer to the question of how to win at roulette, since there are so many different strategies that could potentially work. However, we have identified five of the most successful methods that have a high chance of winning you money at the roulette table – read on to find out how you can too!

1. The Martingale Strategy

The Martingale strategy is one of the most popular and well-known strategies for Roulette, and it’s easy to see why – it’s simple to follow and has a high success rate. The basic premise of the Martingale strategy is that you double your bet after each loss until you win, which will recover all of your previous losses and then some. While it may sound like a risk-free plan, there is one catch – if you lose again after doubling your bet, you will have lost everything. However, as long as you stick to betting low-stakes amounts and are comfortable with potentially losing your entire bankroll, this can be a very successful strategy.

2. The James Bond Strategy

Another popular strategy for Roulette is the James Bond strategy, which is also known as the Reverse Martingale. This strategy involves increasing your bets after wins instead of losses, in the hope that you will eventually make more winning bets than losing ones and end up ahead overall. Unlike the Martingale strategy, there is no risk of losing everything if you happen to go on a losing streak – but this also means that there is less potential for making big profits. If you’re comfortable with smaller wins and want to play it safe, then the James Bond strategy could be right for you.

3. The D’Alembert Strategy

The D’Alembert strategy is another option for those looking for a safer way to win at roulette. This approach is based on reducing your bets by one unit after every loss, in order to ensure that you always have some money left in case of another setback. While it may take longer to achieve success using this method compared to some of the others listed here, it’s still a viable option for those who want to minimise their risk as much as possible. Just remember not to get too greedy if things are going well – it’s always better to leave while you’re ahead!

4. The Fibonacci System

The Fibonacci system is another mathematical approach that can be used when playing Roulette. This technique takes into account natural patterns found in mathematics in order to help predict future results. While there is no guarantee that this system will work 100% of the time, following its guidelines does tend to give players an edge over the house – making it a good choice for those looking for a reliable method. Just be aware that it can take some practice before being able to use this system effectively.

5. The Labouchere System

Last but not least, we have the Labouchere system – another mathematically based approach that can be used when playing Roulette. This system works by constructing a ‘series’ of numbers which are then used as betting units; when you lose a bet, the number at the end of the series gets crossed out and added onto the beginning of the series; when you win a bet, one number gets crossed out (you don’t add anything on). As with any other mathematical system, though, there is no guarantee of success with this method – so only use it if you feel confident in your abilities!

In roulette, you can bet on a single number, on a range of numbers, or on whether the ball will land in black or red. You can also bet on whether the number will be odd or even, high (19-36) or low (1-18), and whether the number will be in the top third (1-12), bottom third (13-24), or middle third (25-36) of the wheel.

The table below summarizes the different types of bets and their odds.

For example, if you bet on 7 to 17, you are betting that the ball will land in one of those eight numbers.

Black/Red: 
You are betting on whether the ball will land in black or red and have a 50% chance of winning.

#  Get the Edge at Roulette with Norm Squire’s Winning Strategy

In Roulette, as in any casino game, the house always has an edge. That edge is the mathematical advantage the casino has over players that allows it to make money in the long run.

However, there are ways to reduce that edge and even tilt it in your favor. One of those ways is to use a winning strategy like the one developed by Norm Squire.

Squire’s strategy is based on a few simple rules: bet on red or black, don’t bet on odd or even, and don’t bet on high or low numbers. By following these simple rules, you reduce the house edge from 5.26% to 2.70%.

While that may not seem like much, it can add up over time. In fact, using Squire’s strategy can increase your chances of winning by almost 50%.

So how do you use Squire’s strategy? The easiest way is to use a betting chart like the one below.

Bet Type Bet Amount House Edge Red 1 unit 2.70% Black 1 unit 2.70% Odd 1 unit 2.70% Even 1 unit 2.70% High 1 unit 2.70% Low 1 unit 2.70%
