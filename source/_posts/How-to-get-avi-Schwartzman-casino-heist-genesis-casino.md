avi Schwartzman, the lead singer of the 80s hair metal band "Razor", was jailed in 1989 for masterminding the biggest casino heist in US history.

Now, almost 30 years later, Schwartzman has finally revealed how he pulled off the heist.

"It was all about being prepared," Schwartzman said in a recent interview. "I did my research and picked the right casino."

Schwartzman targeted the Genesis Casino, which was known for its lax security. He arrived at the casino on a motorbike, with a helmet and a bag full of props that he had borrowed from a friend who worked in a theatre.

He entered the casino and began to play blackjack. Once he had gained the trust of the casino staff, he asked to see the security footage from the previous night.

"I had brought along a clip-on tie and some fake facial hair," Schwartzman said. "I put on the beard and then I put on the tie, so that it looked like I was wearing a clip-on microphone."

Schwartzman then took out his 'microphone' and began to pretend to be a reporter filming a news report on the casino. He interviewed various members of staff, including the security guard who was responsible for monitoring the CCTV footage.

"I even managed to get him to show me where the control room was," Schwartzman said. "Once I knew where it was, I just walked in and grabbed the tapes."

Schwartzman made his escape on his motorbike, with over $1 million worth of tapes under his arm. He hid them at his home until they could be smuggled overseas to Switzerland.


 The Genesis Casino Heist was one of the most daring robberies in recent memory. Avant-garde musician Avi Schwartzman pulled it off with panache and style, making sure to thoroughly plan everything out before executing it flawlessly. While casinos have increased their security measures since 1989, this caper is still an impressive feat that is remembered by many gaming enthusiasts to this day

The robbery took place on Saturday night shortly after 10 p.m., when a group of about eight men entered the casino through a rear entrance and proceeded to make their way to the high-stakes gaming area. There, they smashed open several display cases and made off with the avi Schwartzman chips.
