#  Aquila Basket Trento Rolls Over Online Sports Betting Sites

The Italian basketball club Aquila Basket Trento (pictured) handily defeated the top online sports betting sites on Monday. The game, which was played in Trento, Italy, ended with a final score of 108-64 in favor of Aquila.

This was not the first time that Aquila has bested the betting sites; they also emerged victorious when the two teams met in December of last year. The difference this time around was that the sites had made significant changes to their odds in light of Aquila’s recent successes.

One site, for example, had Aquila at a 2-to-1 underdog heading into Monday’s match. But Aquila dominated from beginning to end, led by American forward Bryant Dunston and power forward Luca Lechthaler. Dunston finished with 22 points and 8 rebounds, while Lechthaler added 18 points and 11 rebounds.

The loss is a major blow to the online sports betting industry, which has been eagerly waiting for an upset victory by one of its teams. Sites are now faced with refunding millions of dollars in bets placed on the game, many of which were placed at very short odds.

This is not the first time that the betting industry has been dealt a major blow; in November of last year, Leicester City—a far lesser known team than Aquila—defeated 5-time English Champions Chelsea in one of the biggest upsets in sports history. That victory cost bookmakers millions of dollars in payouts.
