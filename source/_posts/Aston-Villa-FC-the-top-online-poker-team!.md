#  Aston Villa - top dog in online poker

One thing that still stands strong in the English Premier League is the fan base. Regardless of where a team is in the standings, fans will travel and fill the stadium. No club typifies this more than Aston Villa.

This year, Aston Villa is sitting near the bottom of the table; however, this has not stopped their fans from traveling and filling stadiums. The away match against Norwich City was no exception. The game was played at Carrow Road, which can hold up to 27,000 spectators. Despite Villa being in last place and Norwich being in 14th, the game sold out days before kickoff.

The fans have been there through thick and thin for Aston Villa, but what has kept them coming back? One reason is that Aston Villa is one of the top online poker clubs in Europe. In fact, they are ranked 5th overall on Poker Scout. This ranking is based on a variety of factors such as average player money won/lost (PL), cash game players (NLHE), tournament players (MTD) and liquidity points (LP).

What makes Aston Villa so successful online? Their cash game players are some of the most aggressive in Europe. On a per 100 hands basis, their players lose an average of 3.1 big blinds (bb). This ranks them 9th overall when compared to other European clubs. However, where they rank first is in terms of liquidity points. This means that they generate more money for the poker sites than any other club.

To put this into perspective, if you were to play at €5/$5 stakes on a site like PokerStars, you would generate €2,500 per hour in rake revenue for the site. Aston Villa generates over €10,000 per hour! This is thanks to their high-volume players who are always pushing all-in preflop.

While their aggressive style can sometimes lead to big losses, it also leads to some huge wins. In October 2017, one of their players took down a €102,000 ($121,000) pot at a final table of an online tournament. This just goes to show that when it comes to online poker, Aston Villa is definitely top dog!
