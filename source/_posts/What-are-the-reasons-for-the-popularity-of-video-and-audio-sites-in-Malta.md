#  What are the reasons for the popularity of video and audio sites in Malta?

The Maltese islands are located in the central Mediterranean Sea, 93 km south of the Italian island of Sicily and 288 km north of Africa. The archipelago has a population of around 450,000 inhabitants and a GDP per capita of around €22,000. Malta is a member country of the European Union and adopted the euro as its currency in 2008.

Malta is an interesting country from a digital perspective. According to 2016 data from the European Commission, Malta has one of the highest proportions of people using the internet (98% of Maltese citizens use the internet). In addition, Malta ranks high in terms of online activities such as using social networks (94%) and using e-commerce (82%).

The popularity of video and audio sites in Malta is likely due to several factors. First, Maltese citizens have high levels of digital literacy and are comfortable using the internet for various activities. Second, there is a high level of broadband penetration in Malta, with over 90% of households having access to broadband speeds of 30 Mbps or more. This means that Maltese citizens have fast and reliable access to the internet which they can use to watch videos and listen to audio content.

Finally, there is a strong tradition of media production in Malta dating back to the early days of radio broadcasting. This has resulted in a number of notable audio and video sites being established in Malta, including One TV, Net TV, and Attitude FM. These sites offer a wide range of content catering to different interests and demographics, making them popular among Maltese citizens.

#  Why do people prefer these sites over others?

People use social media for a variety of reasons. Some people use it to stay connected with friends and family, others use it to find out about current events, and still others use it to stay up-to-date on the latest trends.

 regardless of why people use them, social media sites have become incredibly popular. In fact, in a 2017 study by GlobalWebIndex, it was found that almost half of the world’s population (2.89 billion people) uses social media. And that number is only rising.

So, what makes social media so popular? Why do people prefer these sites over others?

There are a few reasons. First, social media is convenient. It’s easy to access, and you can use it from anywhere – at home, work, or on the go. Second, social media is interactive. It allows users to communicate with one another, share ideas and thoughts, and connect in ways that weren’t possible before. Third, social media is engaging. It offers users a variety of content options, from news articles and blog posts to videos and photos. Finally, social media is affordable. Most sites are free to join and use, which makes them accessible to everyone.
