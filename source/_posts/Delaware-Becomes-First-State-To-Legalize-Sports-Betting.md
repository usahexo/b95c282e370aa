#  Delaware Becomes First State To Legalize Sports Betting

On Tuesday, June 5th, the Delaware Senate voted to legalize sports betting in the state. This made Delaware the first state in the US to legalize sports betting since the Supreme Court overturned the federal ban on it last month.

Gov. John Carney is expected to sign the bill into law, which will allow casinos and racetracks in Delaware to offer sports betting. Bettors will be able to place bets on NFL, NBA, MLB, and NHL games, as well as college games.

The move is seen as a way to help Delaware’s struggling casinos and racetracks. Jerry Markon of the Washington Post writes:

“State officials said they were confident that legalized sports betting would produce hundreds of new jobs and help combat years of decline in casino revenues. Delaware’s three casinos have lost nearly half their workforce since 2007.”

It remains unclear how much money Delaware can expect to make from sports betting. In Nevada, which was the first state to legalize sports betting, total bets only amounted to 2% of casino revenue in 2017. However, with more states legalizing sports betting, that percentage is likely to rise.

#  Delaware Becomes First State To Authorize Sports Gambling

On June 5, 2018, the Delaware State Senate passed a bill that would legalize sports gambling in the state. The House of Representatives had passed the bill two weeks earlier. The bill now goes to Governor John Carney for his signature.

If signed into law, the bill would allow sports betting at casinos and racetracks in Delaware. Bettors would be able to place wagers on professional and collegiate sporting events. The bill would also establish a regulatory framework for sports gambling in Delaware.

Delaware is the first state to authorize sports gambling since the US Supreme Court struck down a federal ban on sports betting last month. The court's decision opens the door for other states to legalize sports gambling.

Some lawmakers in New Jersey are pushing for a quick vote on a sports betting bill in that state. Other states, such as Pennsylvania and West Virginia, are also considering bills to legalize sports betting.

#  Delaware Opens Up Sports Betting Operations

Delaware became the first US state outside of Nevada to offer full sports betting operations starting July 1st. Bettors can now place wagers on a variety of sports events at the state’s three casinos - Delaware Park, Harrington Raceway and Dover Downs.

Casino officials are expecting a surge in business with the NFL preseason underway and the start of the new college football season just around the corner. The move is also seen as a way to help bolster Delaware's casino industry, which has taken hits in recent years from increased competition from neighbouring states.

The first legal sports bet in Delaware was placed at Harrington Raceway on Monday morning. It was a $10 wager on the Cleveland Indians to beat the Detroit Tigers in their upcoming game.

Delaware is one of six states that have been given permission by the US Supreme Court to offer sports betting following its landmark decision in May to overturn a 25-year ban on such activities. New Jersey is expected to be operational within days, while other states including West Virginia, Pennsylvania and Mississippi are months away from offering sports betting.

# The Future of Sports Betting in America

The repeal of the federal ban on sports betting has sparked intense interest among casino operators and state governments across the United States eager to tap into what is estimated to be a $150 billion market.

Industry analysts say that up to 30 states could eventually offer some form of legalized sports betting, although questions remain about how heavily it will be regulated and taxed. There is also concern among some that expanded gambling could lead to increased incidents of problem gambling.

The American Gaming Association (AGA) estimates that $4.5 billion was wagered illegally on US sporting events last year, with only $1.5 billion bet legally through Nevada's casinos. Delaware's move could provide a glimpse into how much revenue states can expect from legalized sports betting operations.

# The Pros and Cons of Sports Betting

Proponents of legalized sports betting argue that it would generate billions of dollars in revenue for cash-strapped state governments, while providing a new source of entertainment for fans of all ages. They also contend that it would create hundreds of jobs in the gaming industry and stimulate economic growth by encouraging consumers to spend more money locally.



Opponents argue that expanded gambling could lead to an increase in problem gambling rates, as well as other social ills such as crime and corruption. They also assert that it would give an unfair advantage to casinos and other gaming interests over traditional forms of entertainment such as horse racing and baseball.

#  Delaware Now Allows You To Place Bets On Your Favorite Sports Teams

The great state of Delaware has made a new law that allows people to place bets on their favorite sports teams. Known as the "Intrastate Sports Betting Act", this new law is expected to generate millions of dollars in revenue for the state.

This new law will allow casinos and racetracks throughout Delaware to offer betting on professional and college sports events. Bettors will be able to place bets both online and in person, and there will be a wide variety of bets available, including point spreads, money lines, and over/under bets.

In order to ensure that everything is run fairly, the Delaware State Lottery will be responsible for regulating the sports betting industry. The Lottery will also be responsible for issuing licenses to casinos and racetracks, and it will have the authority to suspend or revoke licenses if there are any problems with the way that the betting is being conducted.

Delaware is not the first state to offer sports betting, but it is one of the few states where you can bet on your favorite team. In most other states, sports betting is limited to professional games only.

According to John Maese, a gaming analyst with Spectrum Gaming Group, this new law could generate as much as $50 million in revenue for Delaware each year. This money would go towards helping to fund programs for senior citizens and children, as well as other important state initiatives.

So if you're a fan of the Delaware Blue Hens or any other team in the state, make sure you head down to your local casino or racetrack and place a bet!

#  Delaware Is The First State To Offer legalized Sports Betting

In a landmark decision on Tuesday, the Supreme Court of the United States struck down a federal law that effectively banned sports betting nationwide. The law, known as the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA), had been in place for more than 25 years.

The ruling clears the way for states to legalize and regulate sports betting within their borders. Immediately following the ruling, Delaware announced that it would become the first state to offer legalized sports betting.

"We are ready to move forward, and we will issue regulations immediately," said Delaware Governor John Carney. "We expect this will create new jobs and economic activity in our state."

Other states are likely to follow Delaware's lead, as they race to capitalize on what is expected to be a multibillion-dollar industry. Ernst & Young has estimated that legal sports betting could generate $7 billion in annual revenue nationwide.

The potential benefits for states are clear. Not only could they generate significant tax revenue, but they could also create new jobs in the gaming industry. In addition, legalizing sports betting could help stem the illegal gambling market, which is estimated to be worth billions of dollars annually.

Opponents of legalized sports betting argue that it could lead to increased rates of problem gambling. However, there is no evidence that this is actually the case. In fact, many experts believe that regulating sports betting can actually help protect consumers and make gambling safer.

In any event, it is clear that the landscape of gambling in America is about to change dramatically. With Tuesday's ruling, the door has been opened for states to tap into a new source of revenue and create thousands of jobs. It will be interesting to see which states are quickest to take advantage of this opportunity.
