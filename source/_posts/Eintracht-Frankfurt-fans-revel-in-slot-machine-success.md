Eintracht Frankfurt's slot machine helped them to a 2-1 victory over SC Freiburg on Sunday. The Bundesliga side took the lead in the first half when Sebastien Haller converted from the spot after he had been fouled by Caglar Soyuncu.

Haller then doubled the lead early in the second half with a fine finish, but Florian Niederlechner pulled one back for Freiburg in the closing stages. However, Frankfurt held on for all three points to maintain their unbeaten start to the season.

The win came thanks in part to some good fortune, as Eintracht's slot machine played its part in both goals. But manager Adi Hutter was just happy that his team had come away with all three points.

"It's not about luck," he said after the match. "Luck is when you don't make mistakes and we had a bit of luck today - but we also deserved it."

Eintracht now sit third in the Bundesliga table, behind Borussia Dortmund and RB Leipzig, and will be looking to continue their good form when they take on Hertha Berlin in their next match.

#  How slot machines work: Eintracht Frankfurt style

Slot machines and other casino games always fascinate people. How do they work? What makes them so attractive? Do they actually have any chances of winning? In this article, we are going to take a closer look at slot machines, their history and how they work.



Slot machines are usually the first game people think of when they think about casinos. They are simple to play and can be quite lucrative. But how do they work? What makes them so attractive? Are there any real chances of winning? Let's take a closer look at slot machines and their history.

The first slot machines were created in the late 1800s as mechanical devices. These were called "One-Armed Bandits" because they had a lever on one side that you pulled to spin the reels. If you got 3 of the same symbol on the pay line, you would win the jackpot. Over time, these mechanical devices were replaced by electromechanical ones which used motors to spin the reels. Finally, in 1975, Microgaming created the first online casino and slot machines began to be available on the internet.

Nowadays, slot machines come in all shapes and sizes. There are traditional 3-reel slots with symbols like fruit or bells; 5-reel slots with bonus rounds and animated characters; and even progressive jackpot slots where the jackpot prize increases with each bet until it is won. Most slots have a fixed number of pay lines (usually between 20 and 50) but you can also find some with 243 different ways to win.

To play a slot machine, you first need to decide how much money you want to bet per spin. This is usually done by setting a value on a number of coins (between 1 and 100). You can then press the "spin" button or pull the lever to start playing. The reels will start spinning and eventually stop on one of several different outcomes. You might get a winning combination on one or more pay lines; you might get a losing combination; or you might just end up with nothing at all.

If you get a winning combination on one or more pay lines, your payout will depend on what symbols are involved and how much money you wagered per spin. The most common symbols are cherries, bells, BARs, etc., but there can be dozens of different symbols on each reel. The jackpot prize is usually awarded for getting 5 matching symbols in a row (on an active pay line). However, some slots have multi-million dollar jackpots that can be won by getting just 2 matching symbols!

So do slot machines actually have any chances of winning? The answer is yes - but your chances depend on which machine you're playing! Some slots are easier to win than others, so it's important to do your research before playing. That being said, there is no such thing as a "guaranteed" win when playing slots - even if you're playing a machine that's supposed to be "easy". So if you're looking for guaranteed excitement and profits, casino games like blackjack or roulette might be more suited to your interests!
