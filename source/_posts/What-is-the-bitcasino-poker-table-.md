#  What is the bitcasino poker table? 

The bitcasino poker table is a virtual table where players can play poker against each other. The table is made up of a number of squares, each of which can hold one player. The table is displayed on the player's computer screen and the players use their mouse or keyboard to interact with the table.

To join the table, a player clicks on the 'join' button and selects the desired game type. They are then placed in the next available seat. The table will seat up to ten players, but will start with fewer players if there are not enough people online at the same time.

The game begins when one of the players at the table starts a new hand by clicking on the 'deal' button. The dealer then gives each player two cards face down and one card face up. The face up card is called the 'open card'.

The betting rounds begin with the player who has the best hand showing and continue clockwise around the table. In bitcasino poker, there are three betting rounds - preflop, flop and turn - as well as a river round which takes place after all of the other rounds have been completed.
