        <h1 id="Rams-set-to-face-Seattle-Seahawks-in-Week-5"><a href="#Rams-set-to-face-Seattle-Seahawks-in-Week-5" class="headerlink" title="Rams set to face Seattle Seahawks in Week 5"></a>Rams set to face Seattle Seahawks in Week 5</h1><p>The Rams are set to take on the Seattle Seahawks in Week 5 of the 2017 NFL season. The Seahawks come into the matchup as 3 point favorites, according to Vegas odds.</p>
<p>The Rams are coming off of a bye week, while the Seahawks suffered a loss to the Tennessee Titans last week.</p>
<p>The Rams have had a disappointing start to the season, with a record of 2-2. The offense has been struggling, scoring just 16 points per game, ranking 31st in the league. The defense has been playing well, allowing just 17 points per game, which ranks 8th in the league.</p>
<p>The Seahawks come into the game with a record of 3-1. The offense has been averaging 24 points per game, which ranks 12th in the league. The defense has been allowing just 15 points per game, which ranks 4th in the league.</p>
<p>The Rams will need to play better offensively if they want to have a chance against the Seahawks. The Rams’ defense will need to continue playing well if they want to keep Seattle from scoring too many points.</p>
<h1 id="Todd-Gurley-among-Week-5’s-players-to-watch"><a href="#Todd-Gurley-among-Week-5’s-players-to-watch" class="headerlink" title="Todd Gurley among Week 5’s players to watch"></a>Todd Gurley among Week 5’s players to watch</h1><p>It might be stating the obvious, but Los Angeles Rams running back Todd Gurley is one of the players to watch in Week 5. The 2017 Offensive Player of the Year has been off to a bit of a slower start this season, averaging just 3.8 yards per carry heading into Sunday’s game against the Seattle Seahawks.</p>
<p>Gurley had his best game of the season last week against the Minnesota Vikings, rushing for 97 yards and two touchdowns on 19 carries. This week, he’ll face a Seahawks defense that has allowed 4.4 yards per carry and ranks 18th in the NFL in rushing defense.</p>
<p>If Gurley can have another big game against Seattle, it could go a long way in helping the Rams improve to 4-1 on the season.</p>
<h1 id="What-to-know-about-the-Rams’-next-opponent-Seattle-Seahawks"><a href="#What-to-know-about-the-Rams’-next-opponent-Seattle-Seahawks" class="headerlink" title="What to know about the Rams’ next opponent: Seattle Seahawks"></a>What to know about the Rams’ next opponent: Seattle Seahawks</h1><p>The Seattle Seahawks invade Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum for a Week 5 NFC West matchup against the Rams. Here are three things to know about the Rams’ next opponent:</p>
<ol>
<li>Seattle is coming off a tough loss</li>
</ol>
<p>After starting the season with two wins, the Seahawks fell to the Chicago Bears 24-17 on Sunday. While quarterback Russell Wilson had a solid outing, completing 23 of his 35 passes for 298 yards and two touchdowns, the Bears’ defense was able to slow down Seattle’s rushing attack, limiting them to just 73 yards on the ground. The Seahawks will need to get their running game going if they want to beat the Rams on Sunday.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>The Rams have won their last two meetings against Seattle</li>
</ol>
<p>In fact, the Rams have won six of the last seven matchups against their division rivals. This is in large part due to the Rams’ stout defense; in those seven games, they’ve only allowed an average of 16 points per game. The Seahawks will need to find a way to score more points than they have in their first three games this season if they want to come away with a win on Sunday.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>The Rams are at home this week</li>
</ol>
<p>After playing back-to-back road games against the Minnesota Vikings and Seattle Seahawks, the Rams will finally be playing at home this week. This could be a big advantage for them; in their first two home games this season, they’ve outscored their opponents 79-24. With a raucous home crowd behind them, look for the Rams to put up a good fight against Seattle on Sunday.</p>
<h1 id="Rams-continue-preseason-preparations-with-joint-practice-against-Chargers"><a href="#Rams-continue-preseason-preparations-with-joint-practice-against-Chargers" class="headerlink" title="Rams continue preseason preparations with joint practice against Chargers"></a>Rams continue preseason preparations with joint practice against Chargers</h1><p>The Los Angeles Rams opened their preseason slate with a 30-19 victory over the Oakland Raiders. The team now turns its attention to its second exhibition game, a joint practice against the Los Angeles Chargers on Wednesday.</p>
<p>“It’ll be good,” head coach Sean McVay said of the joint session. “I think both sides of the ball are looking forward to it. It’ll be a good test for us.”</p>
<p>The Rams will get a good look at the Chargers, who they open the regular season against on September 10. Los Angeles has already played two preseason games, with a win over Seattle and a loss to New Orleans.</p>
<p>Quarterback Philip Rivers and the first-team offense is expected to see some action against Jared Goff and the Rams’ starters. Melvin Gordon, Keenan Allen and Antonio Gates are among the Chargers players who will also see playing time.</p>
<p>“It’s going to be fun,” Goff said of going up against Rivers. “He’s one of the best in the business.”</p>
<p>The Rams and Chargers kicked off their joint practice with some punting drills. Then it was onto 11-on-11 work, with quarterbacks throwing to receivers running various routes. There was also some one-on-one work, including offensive linemen going up against defensive linemen and linebackers matched up against tight ends and running backs.</p>
<p>Defensive lineman Michael Brockers said it was important for the Rams to face someone other than their own teammates.</p>
<p>“It’s definitely good to go against other people,” Brockers said. “We’re getting better every day.”</p>
<h1 id="Sean-McVay-impressed-with-Rams-after-Week-3-of-preseason"><a href="#Sean-McVay-impressed-with-Rams-after-Week-3-of-preseason" class="headerlink" title="Sean McVay impressed with Rams after Week 3 of preseason"></a>Sean McVay impressed with Rams after Week 3 of preseason</h1><p>Sean McVay is looking like a genius. The Los Angeles Rams hired the 31-year-old coach this offseason, and many observers were questioning the move. But McVay has impressed in the preseason, and that continued in Week 3 against the Chargers.</p>
<p>The Rams looked good on both sides of the ball, with Jared Goff looking sharp and Todd Gurley running well. McVay was particularly pleased with Goff’s performance, praising his decision-making and accuracy.</p>
<p>There are still concerns about the Rams defense, but McVay has to be encouraged by what he’s seen from his team so far. It’s clear that he has a lot of talent at his disposal, and if he can continue to develop Goff into a top quarterback, the Rams could be contenders in 2017.</p>
